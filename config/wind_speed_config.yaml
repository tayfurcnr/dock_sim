# Wind Speed Indicator Controller Configuration
# Controls rotation of ruzgar_hiz joint based on real-time wind speed data

wind_speed_indicator:
  # Scaling factor: angular velocity (rad/s) = wind speed (m/s) * scale_factor
  # Example: 10 m/s wind speed with 0.5 scale = 5 rad/s rotation (~47 RPM)
  velocity_scale_factor: 0.5  # rad/s per m/s

  # Maximum rotation speed in rad/s
  # Prevents unrealistic spinning in extreme wind conditions
  max_velocity: 10.0

  # Minimum rotation speed in rad/s
  # Indicator will be stationary when wind speed is zero or very low
  min_velocity: 0.0

  # Control loop update rate in Hz
  # How often velocity commands are published to the controller
  update_rate: 10

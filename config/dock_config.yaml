# Dock Station Configuration
# Controls the movement parameters for the revolute (hinge) dock covers
# All position values are in RADIANS (not meters) for revolute joints

dock_station:
  # Movement positions (in radians for revolute joints)
  open_position: 1.57     # ~90 degrees - fully open (vertical)
  closed_position: 0    # Slightly negative to close the gap between lids

  # Movement directios (for mirrored joints)
  # If lids open in opposite directions, one may need -1.0
  left_direction: 1.0         # kapak1j direction (1.0 = normal, -1.0 = reverse)
  right_direction: 1.0        # kapak2j direction (same as kapak1j - test if both move)

  # Position tolerance for state detection (in radians)
  position_tolerance: 0.0    # How close to target before considering "arrived" (~3 degrees)

  # Timeout for operations (in seconds)
  timeout: 30.0               # Maximum time to wait for movement completion

  # Update rate
  control_rate: 10            # Hz - how often to publish state updates
